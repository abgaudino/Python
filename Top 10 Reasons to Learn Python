#What is Python?
##Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language with built-in data structures and dynamic semantics
#Reasons to Learn Python

# #10 - Ease of Use - simple syntax
#Example:
#Printing "Hello World" in Java               |    Printing "Hello World" in Python
#                                             |    
#  public class Main                          |   
#  {                                          |         print("Hello World")
#    public static void main(String[] args){  |
#        System.out.printIn("Hello World");   |
#    }                                        |
#  }                                          |
